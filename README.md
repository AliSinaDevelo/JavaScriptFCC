# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

This repository contains my solutions to the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures projects from freeCodeCamp.
About

The JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification is a series of challenges and projects designed to test your understanding of basic JavaScript concepts and algorithms. The certification covers topics such as basic data structures, recursion, functional programming, and more.

In this repository, you will find my solutions to the five final projects in the certification:

 Palindrome Checker/
 Roman Numeral Converter/
 Caesars Cipher/
 Telephone Number Validator/
 Cash Register

# Usage

You can view my solutions to each project by navigating to the corresponding folder in this repository. Each folder contains a separate JavaScript file with my solution, as well as a README file with a description of the project and the requirements.

Feel free to use my code as a reference, or as a starting point for your own solutions to the projects. Keep in mind that there are often multiple ways to solve these problems, and my solutions may not be the most efficient or elegant.
Installation

To run these projects locally, you will need to have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download and install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/
